#  This utility moves an entire directory sctructure from
#  one place to another.  The source must be a directory and 
#  and the destination must not already exist.
#
#  Examples:   MVDIR  PATRICK  HOME/PATRICK will move the 
#     subdirectory PATRICK and all the files and dirs in it to the 
#     new location of HOME/PATRICK, HOME having to exist but HOME/PATRICK not.
