#  This script creates Bootable A2osX Disks.
#
#  This script will prompt the user for any needed information
#  such as version of PRODOS to include and then will verify that 
#  it has the right media and files available.
#
#  Note this is the first version of the script so it may not 
#  include the finished/polished UI that is planned.
#
#  Media Types: RELEASE, RC, STABLE, and BLEED.
#  Media Formats: 140K, 800K, and 32MB.
#
#  First we define the functions this script uses.
