File: MAN/MAN

man: man [command|topic]

    Man formats and displays on-line manual pages for commands and topics of A2osX.
    The man shell script looks for a manpage file for the argument (command or topic)
    and if it finds a corresponding file uses more to display the contents.  If no
    argument is passed to man, then this page is displayed.  If no file is found for
    argument then an error is displayed.  Man looks for its man pages in 
    ${root}usr/share/man.

    Available man files are:
