                      A2osX ADM Update Help
BL
The adm update command allows you to update your current A2osX installation
to the latest build.  This command requires a properly installed, configured
and running network infastructure.  Update will test that the update.a2osx.net
server can be reached.  Update will then compare the currently running version
with the latest version available on the update server.  
BL
The update process will install new system files, bins and even an updated
version of ProDOS FX.  It will not change files in user home directories
or configuration files stored in ./etc (other then updated the version file
itself).

                         A2osX Edit Help
BL
The edit command allows the user to interactively read and edit standard text
files in A2osX.  If you do not specify a file name on the command line, you 
will be prompted to enter one when you save your work (control-S).  Consult 
the help screen below for a list of the special keys that can be used while 
editing a file.
BL
A note for the touch typists!: While edit is not a word processor, it still is
one of the most complex programs included in A2osX.  It does a lot!  A side 
affect of this, and due to the lack of a keyboard buffer in the Apple //e, if
you try to speed type while using EDIT some keystrokes may be dropped.  This
is most noticeable when using the AppleWin emulator set to 1.0 speed.  
Changing the emulator speed to at least 2.0 will significantly reduce or 
eliminate the dropped keys.

                A2osX Shell CD Command Help
BL
	cd <value>
BL
The cd command is used to change the current working directory. You must
supply the cd command a valid relative or absolute path.  Examples of
relative paths include subdir1 (a sub-directory in the current directory),
../subdir2 (a sub-directory in the parent of the current directory), and
subdir1/subdir3 ( a sub-directory in the sub-directory subdir1 of the current
directory). An absolute path always begins with a / and includes the volume
name of the disk drive to which change the current working directory such as
/MYVOL1/var/logs (the sub-directory logs in the directory var on the disk
with a volume label of MYVOL1).
PAGE
You can use the pwd command to display the current working directory if your
prompt ($) does not automatically display it on the command line (the default,
set in your PROFILE). The current working directory is used by the shell to
look for scripts not located in one of the directories specified by $PATH or
as the directory for reading and writing files when no path is provided by a
command. For example, if you execute the ls command without arguments, ls
assumes to list the files in the current working directory. Similarly, if
you specify a file without a path, for example the command echo Hello >
outfile, shell will place the file outfile in the current working directory.
See the related popd and pushd commands.
