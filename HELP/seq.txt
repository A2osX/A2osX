A2osX seq (bin/seq) Command Help

     seq -- print sequences of numbers

SYNOPSIS
     seq [-f format] [-s string] [-t string] [first [incr]] last

DESCRIPTION
    The seq utility prints a sequence of numbers, one per line (default), from
    first (default 1), to near last as possible, in increments of incr
    (default 1). When first is larger than last the default incr is -1.

    All numbers are interpreted as integer values.

    The seq utility accepts the following options:

    -f format   Use a printf style format to print each number. Only the D, H,
                and I conversion characters are valid, along with any optional
                flags and an optional numeric minimum field width or precision.
                The format can contain character escape sequences in backslash
                notation as defined in A2osX kernel documentation.
                The default is \%I.

    -s string   Use string to separate numbers. The string can contain
                character escape sequences in backslash notation as defined in
                A2osX kernel documentation. The default is \\r\\n.

    -t string   Use string to terminate sequence of numbers. The string can
                contain character escape sequences in backslash notation as
                defined in A2osX kernel documentation. This option is
                useful when the default separator does not contain a \\n.

    The seq utility exits 0 on success and non-zero if an error occurs.

HISTORY
    The seq command first appeared in Plan 9 from Bell Labs. A seq command
    appeared in NetBSD 3.0, and ported to FreeBSD 9.0. This command was based
    on the command of the same name in Plan 9 from Bell Labs and the GNU core
    utilities. The GNU seq command first appeared in the 1.13 shell utilities
    release. The A2osX seq command was developed by Brian J. Bernstein
    <brian@dronefone.com> in November 2021.

BUGS
    Floating point numbers are not supported.

    Does not gracefully handle alpha characters where it expects numbers.
    Behavior of seq when it encounters a non-numeric is undefined.

    This version of seq does not support the -w option which automatically
    sets numerical output to identical width. Instead, use the -f option as
    appropriate to get desired results.
