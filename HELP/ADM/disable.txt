A2osX ADM Update Help

The adm update command allows you to update your current A2osX installation
to the latest build.  This command requires a properly installed, configured
and running network infastructure.  Update will test that the update.a2osx.net
server can be reached.  Update will then compare the currently running version
with the latest version available on the update server.  

The update process will install new system files, bins and even an updated
version of ProDOS FX.  It will not change files in user home directories
or configuration files stored in ./etc (other then updated the version file
itself).
