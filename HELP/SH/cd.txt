    cd <value>

The cd command is used to change the current working directory. You must
supply the cd command a valid relative or absolute path.  Examples of
relative paths include subdir1 (a sub-directory in the current directory),
../subdir2 (a sub-directory in the parent of the current directory), and
subdir1/subdir3 ( a sub-directory in the sub-directory subdir1 of the current
directory). An absolute path always begins with a / and includes the volume
name of the disk drive to which change the current working directory such as
/MYVOL1/var/logs (the sub-directory logs in the directory var on the disk
with a volume label of MYVOL1).

You can use the pwd command to display the current working directory if your
prompt ($) does not automatically display it on the command line (the default,
set in your PROFILE). The current working directory is used by the shell to
look for scripts not located in one of the directories specified by $PATH or
as the directory for reading and writing files when no path is provided by a
command. For example, if you execute the ls command without arguments, ls
assumes to list the files in the current working directory. Similarly, if
you specify a file without a path, for example the command echo Hello >
outfile, shell will place the file outfile in the current working directory.
