TITLE
A2osX which (bin/which) Command Help

     which -- locate a program file in the user's path

SYNOPSIS
     which program ...

DESCRIPTION
    The which utility takes a list of command names and searches the path for
    each and will report back which specific executable would have been picked
    up if the command was actually run.

    The which utility accepts the following options:

    -a          List all instances found instead of just the first one.

    -s          No output, just return 0 if all programs are found, or 1 if
                some were not found.

EXAMPLES
    Locate the cp and ls commands:

        # which cp ls
        /FULL32/bin/cp
        /FULL32/bin/ls

    Do not show output, just return code:

        # which -s seq
        # echo $?
        0

        # which -s fakecmd
        # echo $?
        1


HISTORY
    The which command first appeared in FreeBSD 2.1 and was a Perl script
    written by Wolfram Schneider <wosch@FreeBSD.org>. The A2osX which command
    was developed by Brian J. Bernstein <brian@dronefone.com> in Dec 2022.
