TITLE
A2osX xmastree (bin/xmastree) Command Help

     xmastree -- displays a Christmas tree of user defined height.

SYNOPSIS
     xmastree <height>

DESCRIPTION
    xmastree is a simple console-based utility that displays a Christmas tree
    of user defined height. You provide a height in the range of 1-130 and it
    will produce a Christmas tree of that height. However, 41 is the practical
    maximum for it to display fully on the Apple II's 80-column screen. As
    well, while you can go higher than 41, on the local console display it
    will disappear horizontally off the right side of the screen due to the
    80-column limit.

PAGE
    The xmastree utility does not accept any options, only a single integer to
    specify tree height.

    The xmastree utility always exits with a successful result of 0.

EXAMPLES
    # xmastree 5

HISTORY
    The xmastree utility was originally written in January of 2012 as part of
    a coding kata challenge. Other entries were done in Java, Python, C#, etc.
    and I decided to be different by writing it in 6502 for an Apple II.
    The program sat on a hard drive for almost a decade before I decided to
    port it to A2osX. While I originally did the work during KansasFest 2021,
    I figured I'd wait for December to release it to align with the holiday
    season. Brian J. Bernstein <brian@dronefone.com>, December 2 2021.

BUGS
    Negative values and those greater than an 8-bit (0-255) results are not
    defined, though it will most likely just display a tree of unexpected
    height.
