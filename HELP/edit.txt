A2osX Edit Help

The edit command allows the user to interactively read and edit standard text
files in A2osX.  If you do not specify a file name on the command line, you 
will be prompted to enter one when you save your work (control-S).  Consult 
the help screen below for a list of the special keys that can be used while 
editing a file.

A note for the touch typists!: While edit is not a word processor, it still is
one of the most complex programs included in A2osX.  It does a lot!  A side 
affect of this, and due to the lack of a keyboard buffer in the Apple //e, if
you try to speed type while using EDIT some keystrokes may be dropped.  This
is most noticeable when using the AppleWin emulator set to 1.0 speed.  
Changing the emulator speed to at least 2.0 will significantly reduce or 
eliminate the dropped keys.
