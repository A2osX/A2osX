#  This is a test of passing args
#  This script calls ARGTEST2 passing a known set
#  of arguments which ARGTEST2 checks to verify
#  arg passing works.
#
#  Note that $$ is passed which is this process id
#  and can be checked in ARGTEST2 to compare with
#  parent process id, this will validate both are working.
