check that ${BOOT}tmp exists and if not create it
check again? if so fail?  or RC check the MD/mkdir cmd?

check for existing version file, if not there, set to A2osX/0.94/1111/

check for net loaded?  do deep check?  or just try to ping to update.a2osx.net?

set netcheck = `ping -1 update.a2osx.net 2>/dev/null`

httpget update.a2osx.net -U latest -O ${BOOT}tmp/latest
compare latest and new
if newer...
httpget update.a2osx.net -U update.${build} -O ${BOOT}tmp/update

unpak
fix stuff up like KMs
remove tmp files

should any of these steps be logged somewhere?
